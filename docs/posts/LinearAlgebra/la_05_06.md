## Graphical Description of Solutions

When $$\textbf{A}$$ is $$2 \times 2$$, **algebraic calculations** can be supplemented by a **geometric description** of a systemâ€™s evolution.

We can view the equation $$\textbf{x}_{k+1} = A \textbf{x}_k$$ as a description of what happens to an initial point $$\textbf{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^2 $$ as it is transformed repeatedly by the mapping $$\textbf{x} \mapsto A\textbf{x}$$

The graph of $$\textbf{x}_0, \textbf{x}_1, \cdots, $$ is called a **trajectory** of the dynamical system.

## Example 2

Plot several trajectories of the dynamical system $$\textbf{x}_{k+1} = A \textbf{x}_k$$, when 

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}
.8 & 0 \\
0 & .64
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Solution 

The eigenvalues of $$A$$ are .8 and .64, with eigenvectors $$\textbf{v}_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$\textbf{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$. if $$ \textbf{x}_0 = c_1 \textbf{v}_1 +c_2 \textbf{v}_2 $$, then $$ \textbf{x}_k = c_1 (.8)^k \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + c_2 (.64)^k \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$.

Of course, $$\textbf{x}_k$$ tends to 0 because $$(.8)^k$$ and $$(.64)^k$$ both approach 0 as $$k \leftarrow \infty$$. But **the way $$\textbf{x}_k$$  goes toward 0** is interesting. See Fig. 1 below.

Figure 1 shows the first few terms of several trajectories that begin at points on the boundary of the box with corners at $$(\pm 3,\pm 3)$$. The points on each trajectory are connected by a thin curve, to make the trajectory easier to see.

In example 2, the origin is called an **attractor** of the dynamical system because all trajectories tend toward 0.

In the next example, both eigenvalues of $$A$$ are larger than 1 in magnitude, and 0 is called a **repeller** of the dynamical system.

## Example 3 

Plot several typical solutions of the equation $$\textbf{x}_{k+1} = A \textbf{x}_k$$, where


$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}
1.44 & 0 \\
0 & 1.2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Solution 

The eigenvalues of $$A$$ are 1.44 and 1.2. If $$\textbf{x}_0 = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \end{bmatrix}$$, then $$ \textbf{x}_k = c_1 (1.44)^k \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + c_2 (1.2)^k \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$.

Both terms grow in size, but the first term grows faster.

So the direction of greatest repulsion is the line through 0 and the eigenvector for the eigenvalue of larger magnitude.

Fig. 2 below shows several trajectories that begin at points quite close to 0.
