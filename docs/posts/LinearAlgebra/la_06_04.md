## Theorem 12: QR Factrization of Matrices

* If $$A$$ is an $$m \times n$$ matrix with **linearly independent columns**, then 
* $$A$$ can be factored as $$A=QR$$, where 
* $Q$ is an $$m \times n$$ matrix whose columns form an **orthonormal basis for Col** $$A$$ and 
* $$R$$ is an **upper triangular invertible matrix** with *positive entries on its diagonal*.

### Proof

#### Step1 : Contstruction of $$Q$$

* The columns of $$A$$ form a basis for Col $$A$$ since they are linearly independent. 
* Let these columns be $$\left\{ \textbf{x}_1, \cdots , \textbf{x}_n \right\}$$.
* Then, we can construct the orthonormal basis $$\left\{ \textbf{u}_1, \cdots , \textbf{u}_n \right\}$$ for Col $$A$$ by the **Gram-Schmidt process**. 
* Using this basis, we can construct $$Q$$ as 

$$
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
\textbf{u}_1 & \textbf{u}_2 & \cdots * \textbf{u}_n 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Step2 : Construction of $$R$$

* As shown in the Gram-Schmidt process, for $$k=1, \cdots, n$$, $$\textbf{x}_k$$ is in Span $$\left\{ \textbf{x}_1, \cdots, \textbf{x}_k \right\}$$ = Span $$\left\{ \textbf{u}_1, \cdots, \textbf{u}_k \right\}$$. 
* Therefore, there exists constant $$r_{1k}, \cdots, r_{kk}$$ such that
$$
\textbf{x}_k = r_{1k}\textbf{u}_1 + \cdots + r_{kk} \textbf{u}_k + 0\textbf{u}_k+1 + \cdots + 0\textbf{u}_n
$$
* We can always make $$r_{kk} \ge 0$$ because if $$r_{kk} < 0$$, then we can multiply both $$r_{kk}$$ and $$\textbf{u}_k$$ by -1. 
* Using this linear combination representation, we can construct $$\textbf{r}_k$$, the $$k$$-th column of $$R$$, as
$$
\textbf{r}_k = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{1k} \\
\vdots \\
r_{kk} \\
0 \\
\vdots \\
0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* Thas is, $$\textbf{x}_k = Q \textbf{r}_k$$ for $$k=1, \cdots, n$$. 
* Let $$R=\begin{bmatrix} \textbf{r}_1 & \cdots & \textbf{r}_n \end{bmatrix}. Then,
$$
\begin{align}
A &= \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{x}_1 & \cdots & \textbf{x}_n \end{bmatrix}\\
&=\begin{bmatrix} Q\textbf{r}_1 & \cdots & Q\textbf{r}_n \end{bmatrix}\\
&=QR
\end{align}
$$

* The fact that $$R$$ is invertible follows easily from the fact that the
columns of $$A$$ are linearly independent (Exercise 19). 
* Since $$R$$ is clearly upper triangular and invertible, the diagonal entries $$r_{kk}$$'s should be nonzero. 
* By combining this with the fact that $$r_{kk} ge 0$$, $$r_{kk}$$'s must be positive.
