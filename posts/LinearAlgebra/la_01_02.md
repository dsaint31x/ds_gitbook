# 1.2 Row Reduction and Echelon Forms

 A **nonzero row or column** in a matrix means a row or column that contains at least one nonzero entry.

 A **leading entry** of a row refers to the leftmost nonzero entry in a nonzero row.

## Definition of Echelon Form

 A rectangular matrix is in **echelon form** (or **row echelon form, REF**) 
if it has the following three properties:

* All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros.
* Each **leading entry** of a row is in a column to the right of the **leading entry** of the row above it.
* All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros.


 If a matrix in echelon form satisfies the following additional conditions, 
then it is in **reduced echelon form** (or **reduced row echelon form, RREF**):

* The leading entry in each nonzero row is **1**.
* **Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column**.


> * Echelon form : 사다리꼴
> * Row Echelon form : 행사다리꼴
> * Reduced row echelon form : 기약행사다리꼴.
> echelon = steplike


 An **echelon matrix** (respectively, **reduced echelon matrix**) 
is one that is in **echelon form** (respectively, **reduced echelon form**.)

## Example 1

The following matrices are in echelon form. The leading entries ($$\blacksquare$$) may have any nonzero value; the starred entries(*) may have any value (including zero).

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\blacksquare & * & * & * \\
0 & \blacksquare & * & * \\
0 & 0 & 0 &0 \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 &0  
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$\blacksquare$$


 Any nonzero matrix may be **row reduced** (i.e., *transformed by elementary row operations*) 
into *more than one matrix in* **echelon form**, 
using different sequences of row operations. 
However, the **reduced echelon form** one obtains from a matrix is **unique**.  

---

## Theorem 1: Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form

Each matrix is *row equivalent* to one and **only one reduced echelon matrix**.

---

 If a matrix $$A$$ is row equivalent to an echelon matrix $$U$$, 
we call $$U$$ **an echelon form** (or row echelon form) of $$A$$; 
if $$U$$ is in reduced echelon form, we call $$U$$ **the reduced echelon form of $$A$$**.


## Pivot Position

 Since the reduced echelonform is **unique**, *the leading entries are always in the same positions in any echelon form obtained from a given matrix*.

 These leading entries correspond to leading 1's in the reduced echelon form.

## Definition of Pivot Position and Pivot Column

* A `pivot position` in a matrix $$A$$ is a location in $$A$$ that corresponds to a **leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of $$A$$**. 
* A `pivot column` is a column of $$A$$ that contains a pivot position.

## Example 2

 Row reduce the matrix $$A$$ below to echelon form, and locate the `pivot columns` of $$A$$.

$$
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -3 & -6 & 4 & 9 \\
-1 & -2 & -1 & 3 & 1 \\
-2 & -3 & 0 & 3 & -1 \\
1 & 4 & 5 & -9 & -7
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Solution of Example 2

 The **top of the leftmost nonzero column** is the **first** `pivot position`. 
A nonzero entry, or `pivot`, must be placed in this position.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m01.png)

Create zeros below the pivot, 1, 
by adding multiples of the first row to the rows below, 
and obtain the next matrix.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m02.png)

Add $$\frac{-5}{2}$$ times row 2 to row 3, and 
add $$\frac{3}{2}$$ times row 2 to row 4.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 & 5 & -9 & -7 \\
0 & 2 & 4 & -6 & -6 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 &0 &0 & -5 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

There is no way to create a leading entry in column 3. 
However, if we interchange rows 3 and 4, 
we can produce a leading entry in column 4.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m03.png)

The matrix is in **echelon form** and 
thus reveals that columns 1, 2, and 4 of $$A$$ are `pivot columns`.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m04.png)

The pivots in the example are 1, 2 and -5.

## Row Reduction Algorithm

The algorithm that follows consists of **four steps**, and it produces a matrix in `echelon form`. 

A **fifth step** produces a matrix in `reduced echelon form`.

## Example 3: 

Apply elementary row operations 
to transform the following matrix 
first into **echelon form** and 
then into **reduced echelon form**:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 3 & -6 & 6 & 4 & -5 \\
3 & -7 & 8 & -5 & 8 & 9 \\
3 & -9 & 12 & -9 & 6 & 15
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Solution of Example 3

#### Step 1

> Begin with the **leftmost nonzero column**.
> This is a pivot column. The pivot position is at the
> top.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m05.png)

#### Step 2

> Select a nonzero entry in the pivot column
> as a **pivot**. If necessary, interchange rows to move
> this entry into the **pivot position**.

Interchange rows 1 and 3. (We could have
interchanged rows 1 and 2 instead)

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m06.png)

#### Step 3: 

> Use row replacement operations to **create zeros in all positions below the pivot**.

We could have divided the top row by the pivot, 3, but with two 3s in column 1, 
it is just as easy to add -1 times row 1 to row 2.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m07.png)

#### Step 4: 

> **Cover (or ignore) the row containing the pivot position and cover all rows, if any, above it**. 
> **Apply steps 1~3** to the submatrix that remains. 
> Repeat the process until there are no more nonzero rows to modify.

With row 1 covered, step 1 shows that column 2 is the next pivot column; 
for step 2, select as a pivot the "top" entry in that column.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m08.png)

For step 3, we could insert an optional step of dividing the "top" row of the submatrix by the pivot, 2. 
Instead, we add $$\frac{3}{2}$$ times the "top" row to the row below.

This produces the following matrix.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m09.png)

When we cover the row containing the second pivot
position for step 4, we are left with a new submatrix
that has only one row.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m10.png)

Steps 1~3 require no work for this submatrix, and
we have reached an echelon form of the full matrix.
We perform one more step to obtain the reduced
echelon form.

#### Step 5:

> Beginning with **the rightmost pivot and working upward and to the left**, 
> **create zeros above each pivot**. 
> If a pivot is not 1, make it 1 by a scaling operation.

The rightmost pivot is in row 3. 
Create zeros above it, adding suitable multiples of row 3 to rows 2 and 1.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m11.png)

The next pivot is in row 2. Scale this row, dividing
by the pivot.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m12.png)

Create a zero in column 2 by adding 9 times row 2
to row 1.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m13.png)

Finally, scale row 1, dividing by the pivot, 3.

![mat](./fig/la_01_02_m14.png)

This is the reduced echelon form of the original matrix. $$\blacksquare$$

The combination of steps 1~4 is called the **forward phase** of the row reduction algorithm.
Step 5, which produces the unique reduced echelon form, is called the **backward phase**.


## Solutions of Linear Systems 

 The row reduction algorithm leads to an **explicit description of the solution set of a linear system** 
when the algorithm is applied to the **augmented matrix** of the
system.

 Suppose, for example, that the augmented matrix of a
linear system has been changed into the equivalent
reduced echelon form.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -5 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\
0 &0 &0 &0 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

 There are three variables because the augmented
matrix has four columns. The associated system of
equations is

$$
\begin{align*}
x_1 - 5x_3 & = 1 \\
x_2 +x_3 &= 4 \\
0 &= 0
\end{align*} \tag{4}
$$

 The variables $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ corresponding to pivot columns in the matrix 
are called `basic variables`. The other variable, $$x_3$$ is called a `free variable`.


 Whenever a system is *consistent*, as in (4), 
the solution set can be described explicitly 
by **solving the reduced system of equations 
for the basic variables in terms of the free variables**.
 This operation is possible 
because the reduced echelon form places 
each basic variable 
in one and only one equation (각각의 방정식, 즉 각 행에 하나의 기본변수를 가지는 형태!).
 In (4), solve the first equations for $$x_1$$ and the second for $$x_2$$ 
(Ignore the third equation; it offers no restriction on the variables.)

$$
\begin{align*}
x_1 &= 1 + 5x_3 \\
x_2 &= 4-x_3  \\
x_3 & \text{ is free}
\end{align*} \tag{5}
$$

 **The statement $$x_3 \text{ is free}$$ means that you are free to choose any value for $$x_3$$**.
Once that is done, the formulas in (5) determine the values for $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$.
For instance, when $$x_3=0$$, the solution is (1,4,0); 
when $$x_3=1$$, the solution is (6,3,1).
 Each different choice of $$x_3$$ determines a (different) solution of the system, 
and every solution of the system is determined by a choice of $$x_3$$.

## Parametric Descriptions of Solution Sets

 The description in (5) is **parametric description** of solutions sets in which 
the **free variables act as parameters(매개변수)**.
 *Solving a system* amounts to 
* **finding a parametric description of the solution set** or 
* determining that the **solution set is empty**.

>>>>>>> 2274811c805efacab686aab551c89652ff42e062
 Whenever a system is **consistent and has free variables**, 
the solution set has **many parametric descriptions**.
 For instance, in system (4), we may add 5 times equation 2 to equation 1 
and obtain the following equivalent system


$$
\begin{align*}
x_1 + 5x_2 & = 21 \\
x_2 +x_3 &= 4 \\
\end{align*} 
$$

 We could treat **$$x_2$$ as a parameter** and 
solve for $$x_1$$ and $$x_3$$ in terms of $$x_2$$, and 
we would have an **accurate description of the solution set**.

#### consistent linear system
 Whenever a system is **inconsistent**, 
the **solution set is empty**, even when the system has free variables. 
In this case, the **solution set has no parametric representation**.

## Existence and Uniqueness Qeustions

 When a system is in echelon form and contains no equation of the form $$0=b$$, with $$b$$ nonzero, 
every nonzero equation contains a **basic variable** with a nonzero coefficient.
Either the basic variables are 
* completely determined (with no free variables) or 
* at least one of the basic variables may be expressed in terms of one or more free variables. 

In the former case, there is a **unique solution**; 
in the latter case, there are **infinitely many solutions** (one for each choice of values for the free variables).
These remarks justify the following theorem.

---
## Theorem 2 : Existence and Uniqueness Theorem

A linear system is consistent if and only if 
the rightmost column of the augmented matrix is *not* a pivot column (**$$b$$가 0이 아니면서 $$0=b$$ 형태의 equation**이 없음)
-- i.e.,if and only if an echelon form of the augmented matrix has *no* row of the form

$$
\begin{bmatrix}0 & \cdots & 0 & b \end{bmatrix} \text{ with } b \text{ nonzero.}
$$

If a linear system is consistent, then the solution set contains either 
* (i) a **unique solution**, when there are no free variables, or 
* (ii) **infinitely many solutions**, when there is at least one free variable.

## Using Row Reduction to Solve a Linear System

1. Write the **augmented matrix** of the system.
2. Use the **row reduction algorithm** to obtain an equivalent augmented matrix in echelon form. 
  Decide whether the system is consistent. 
  If there is no solution, stop; otherwise, go to the next step.
3. Continue row reduction to obtain the **reduced echelon form**.
4. Write **the system of equations** corresponding to the matrix obtained in step 3. 
5. Rewrite each nonzero equation from step 4 so that its **one basic variable is expressed in terms of any free variables** appearing in the equation.
