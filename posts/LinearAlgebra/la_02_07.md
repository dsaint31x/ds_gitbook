# 2.7 Applications to Computer Graphics

* Computer graphics are images displayed or animated on a computer screen. 
* Applications of computer graphics are widespread and growing rapidly. 
* For instance, **computer aided design (CAD)** is an integral part of many engineering processes.


Most interactive computer software for business and industry makes use of computer graphics 
in the screen displays and for other functions, such as 
* graphical display of data, 
* desktop publishing, and 
* slide production for commercial and educational presentations. 

Consequently, anyone studying a computer language invariably spends time
learning how to use at least two-dimensional (2D) graphics.

This section examines some of the basic mathematics 
used to manipulate and display graphical images.
* Often, curved lines are approximated by short straight-line segments, and 
* a figure is defined mathematically by **a list of points**.

## EXAMPLE 1 

The capital letter **N** in Figure 1 is determined by eight points, or
vertices. The coordinates of the points can be stored in a data matrix, $$D$$.

In addition to $$D$$, 
it is necessary to specify which vertices are connected by lines, but we omit this detail.

The main reason graphical objects are described by 
collections of straight-line segments is that 
the standard transformations in computer graphics 
**map line segments onto other line segments**.

Once the vertices that describe an object have been transformed, their images can be connected with the
appropriate straight lines to produce the complete image of the original object.

## EXAMPLE 2 

Given $$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & .25 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$, 
describe the effect of the shear transformation 
$$\textbf{x} \mapsto A\textbf{x}$$ on the letter $$N$$ in Example 1.

### Solution 

By definition of matrix multiplication, the columns of the product AD
contain the images of the vertices of the letter N.

$$
\displaystyle AD = \left[\begin{matrix}0 & 0.5 & 2.105 & 6 & 8.0 & 7.5 & 5.895 & 2.0\\0 & 0 & 6.42 & 0 & 8 & 8 & 1.58 & 8\end{matrix}\right]
$$

The transformed vertices are plotted in Figure 2, along with connecting line segments
that correspond to those in the original figure.

The mathematics of computer graphics is intimately connected with matrix multiplication. 
Unfortunately, **translating an object** on a screen does not correspond directly
to **matrix multiplication** 
because *translation is not a linear transformation*. 
The standard way to avoid this difficulty is to introduce what are called **homogeneous coordinates**.

## Homogeneous Coordinates

Each point $$(x,y)$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ 
can be identified with the point $$(x,y,1)$$ on the plane in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$
that lies one unit above the $$xy$$-plane. 

We say that $$(x,y)$$ has ***homogeneous coordinates*** $$(x, y, 1)$$. 
* For instance, the point (0, 0) has homogeneous coordinates (0, 0, 1). 

** Homogeneous coordinates for points** are not added or multiplied by scalars, 
but they can be transformed via multiplication by $$3 \times  3$$ matrices.

### Translation

In homogeneous coordiantes, the translation can be computed via matrix multiplication:

$$
\left[\begin{matrix}1 & 0 & h\\0 & 1 & k\\0 & 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right]
\begin{bmatrix}x \\y \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}x+h \\y+k \\ 1\end{bmatrix} 
$$

## Example 5

Any linear transformation on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ is represented with respect to 
homogeneous coordinates by a partitioned matrix of the form $$\begin{bmatrix}A & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$$,
, where $$A$$ is a $$2\times 2$$ matrix.
