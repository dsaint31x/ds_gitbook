# 2.4 Partitioned Matrices

## Partitioned Matrices

* A key feature of our work with matrices has been **the ability to regard matrix $$A$$ as a *list of columns vectors* ** rather than just a rectangular array of numbers.
* This point of view has been so useful that we wish to consider other **partitions** of $$A$$, indicated by horizontal and vertical dividing rules, as in Example 1 on the next.

> Partition : 분할. ~ to divide matrix into multiple blocks
> * to simplify matrix.
> * to focus on the impotant part of matrix.

### Example 1:

The matrix 

$$
A =\left[ 
\begin{array}{ccc|cc|c} 
3 & 0 & -1 & 5 & 9   & -2 \\
-5 & 2 & 4 & 0 &-3 & 1  \\
\hline
-8 & -6 & 3 & 1 & 7 &-4
\end{array}
\right]
$$

can also be written as the $$2 \times 3$$ **partioned** (or **block**) **matrix**

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11} & A_{12} & A_{13} \\ 
A_{21} & A_{22} & A_{23} 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Whose entries are the blocks (or submatrices)

$$
A_{11}= \begin{bmatrix} 
3 & 0 & -1 \\
-5 & 2 & 4 
\end{bmatrix},
A_{12}= \begin{bmatrix} 
5 & 9 \\ 
0 & -3 
\end{bmatrix},
A_{13}= \begin{bmatrix} 
-2 \\
 1 
\end{bmatrix} \\
A_{21} = \begin{bmatrix} 
-8 & -6 & 3 
\end{bmatrix}, 
A_{22} = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 7 
\end{bmatrix}, 
A_{23} = \begin{bmatrix} 
-4 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Addition and Scalar Multiplication

* If matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$ are the same size and are partitioned in exactly the same way, 
  then it is natural to make the same partition of the **ordinary matrix sum** $$A+B$$
* In this case, each block of $$A+B$$ is 
  the (matrix) sum of the corresponding blocks of $$A$$ and $$B$$.
* **Multiplication of a partitioned matrix by a _scalar_**  is also computed block by block. 

## Multiplication of Partitioned Matrices

* Partitioned matrices can be multiplied 
  by the usual **row–column rule** as if the block entries were scalars, 
  provided that for a product $$AB$$, 
  the column partition of $$A$$ matches the row partition of $$B$$

### Example 3:

Let

$$
A =\left[ 
\begin{array}{ccc|cc} 
-2 & -3 & 1 & 0 & -4  \\
 1 & 5  & 2 & 3 & -1  \\
\hline
 0 & 4 & -2 & 7 & -1
\end{array}
\right]
= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11} & A_{12} \\ 
A_{21} & A_{22} 
\end{bmatrix}
,
$$
$$
B= \left[ 
\begin{matrix} 6 & 4 \\ -2 & 1 \\ -3 & 7 \\ \hline -1 & 3 \\ 5 & 2
\end {matrix}
\right]
=
\begin{bmatrix}
B_1 \\
B_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* The 5 columns of $$A$$ are partitioned into 
  a set of 3 columns and then a set of 2 columns. 
  The 5 rows of $$B$$ are partitioned in the same way
  –into a set of 3 rows and then a set of 2 rows.
* We say that the partitions of $$A$$ and $$B$$ are conformable for block multiplication. 
  It can be shown that the ordinary product $$AB$$ can be written as
$$
AB = \begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11} & A_{12} \\ 
A_{21} & A_{22} 
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
B_1 \\ 
B_2 
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11}B_{1} + A_{12}B_{2} \\ 
A_{21}B_{1} + A_{22}B_{2} 
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\left[ 
\begin{array} 
-5 & 4 \\ 
-6 & 2 \\ 
\hline 
2 & 1 
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

* It is important for each smaller product in the expression for $$AB$$ 
  to be written with **the submatrix from $$A$$** on the left 
  (A로부터 나온 block들도 A처럼 왼쪽에 위치.), 
  since matrix multiplication is not commutative.
* For instance,

$$
A_{11}B_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 
2 & -3 & 1 \\ 
1 & 5 & -2 
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
6 & 4 \\ 
-2 & 1 \\ 
-3 & 7 
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
15 & 12 \\ 
2 & -5 
\end{bmatrix} \\
A_{12}B_2 = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -4 \\ 
3 & -1  
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
-1 & 3 \\ 
5 & 2 
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
-20 & -8 \\
 -8 & 7 
 \end{bmatrix} 
$$

* Hence the top block in $$AB$$ is

$$
A_{11}B_1+A_{12}B_1 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
15 & 12 \\ 
2 & -5 
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
-20 & -8  \\
 -8 & 7 
\end{bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
-5 & 4 \\ 
-6 & 2 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Theorem : Column—Row Expansion of $$AB$$

If $$A$$ is $$m \times n $$ and $$B$$ is $$n \times p$$, then

$$
\begin{align} AB &= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\text{col}_{1}(A) & \text{col}_2(A) & \cdots & \text{col}_n(A) 
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\text{row}_1(B) \\ 
\text{row}_2(B) \\ 
\vdots \\ 
\text{row}_n(B) 
\end{bmatrix} \\
&= 
\text{col}_1(A)\text{row}_1(B) + \cdots + \text{col}_n(A) \text{row}_n(B) \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

### Proof

* For each row index $$i$$ and column index $$j$$, 
  the $$(i, j)$$-entry in $$\text{col}_k(A) \text{row}_k{B}$$ is the product of $$a_{ik}$$ from $$\text{col}_k(A)$$ and $$b_{kj}$$ from $$\text{row}_k(B)$$.
* Hence the $$(i,j)$$-entry in the sum shown in equation (1) is 
$$
\begin{matrix} a_{i1}b_{1j} & + & a_{i2}b_{2j} & + & \cdots & + & a_{in}b_{nj} \\
(k=1)        &   & (k=2)      &   &        &   & (k=n)
\end{matrix}
$$
* This sum is also the $$(i,j)$$-entry in $$AB$$, by the row—column rule.

## Inverses of Partioned Matrices

The next example illustrates calculations involving inverses and partitioned matrices.

## Example 5:

A matrix of the form 
$$
A=\begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11} & A_{12} \\ 
0 & A_{22} 
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 
is said to be *block upper triangular*. Assume that $$A_{11}$$ is $$p \times p$$, $$A_{22}$$ is $$q \times q$$, and $$A$$ is invertible. Find a formula for $$A^{-1}$$.

## Solution 

Denote $$A^{-1}$$ by $$B$$ and partition $$B$$ so that,

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11} & A_{12} \\ 
0 & A_{22} 
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
B_{11} & B_{12} \\ 
B_{21} & B_{22} 
\end {bmatrix} 
= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
I_p & 0 \\ 
0 & I_q 
\end{bmatrix} \tag{2}
$$

* This matrix equation provides four equations that will lead to the unknown blocks, 
  $$B_{11} \cdots, B_{22} $$. 
  Compute the product on the left side of equation (2), and 
  equate each entry with the corresponding block 
  in the identity matrix on the right.
* That is, set

$$
{A_{11}B_{11} + A_{12}B_{21} = I_p}\quad \tag{3} 
$$
$$
{A_{11}B_{12} + A_{12}B_{22} = 0}\quad   \tag{4} 
$$
$$
{A_{22}B_{21} = 0}\quad   \tag{5}
$$
$$
{A_{22}B_{22} = I_q}\quad \tag{6}  
$$

* By itself, equation (6) does not show that $$A_{22}$$ is invertible. 
  However, since $$A_{22}$$ is square, 
  the **Invertible Matrix Theorem** and (6) together show that $$A_{22}$$ is invertible and $$B_{22}=A_{22}^{-1}$$.
* Next, left-multiply both sides of (5) by $$A_{22}^{-1}$$ and obtain 
$$
B_{21}= A_{22}^{-1}0=0
$$.
* So that (3) simplifies to 
$$
A_{11}B_{11}+0 = I_p
$$.
* Since $$A_{11}$$ is square, 
  this shows that $$A_{11}$$ is invertible and 
  $$B_{22}=A_{22}^{-1}$$. 
  Finally, use these results with (4) to find that

$$
A_{11}B_{12} = -A_{12}B_{22} = -A_{12}A_{22}^{-1} \text{ and } B_{12}=A_{11}^{-1}A_{12}A_{22}^{-1}
$$

* Thus

$$
A^{-1}=\begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11} & A_{12} \\ 
0 & A_{22} 
\end{bmatrix} 
=  
\begin{bmatrix} 
A_{11}^{-1} & -A_{11}^{-1}A_{12}A_{22}^{-1} \\ 
0 & A_{22}^{-1} 
\end {bmatrix} \\
\blacksquare
$$

* A **block diagonal matrix** is a partitioned matrix with zero blocks off the main diagonal (of blocks). Such a matrix is **invertible** if and only if **each block on the diagonal is invertible**.
