# 1.1 Systems of Linear Equations (선형방정식계,연립일차방정식)

## Linear Equation

 A **linear equation** in the variables {%math%}x_1, \cdots, x_n{%endmath%} 
is an equation that can be represented in the form

$$
a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n = b \tag{1}
$$

 where {%math%}b{%endmath%}  
and the coefficients {%math%}a_1, \cdots, a_n{%endmath%} 
are real or complex numbers, usually known in advance.


 A **system of linear equations** (or a **linear system**)
is a collection of one or more linear equations
involving the same variables -- say, {%math%}x_1, \cdots, x_n{%endmath%}.

$$
\begin{align}
2x_1 -x_2 +1.5x_3 &= 8 \\
x_1 -4x_3 = -7 \tag{2}
\end{align}
$$


 A **solution** of the system is a list {%math%}\left(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n\right){%endmath%} of numbers 
that makes each equation a true statement 
when the values {%math%}\left(s_1,\cdots,s_n\right){%endmath%} are substituted
for {%math%}x_1, \cdots, x_n{%endmath%} respectively.
 The *set of all possible solutions* is called 
the **solution set** of the linear system.

 Two linear systems are called **equivalent** 
if they have **the same solution set**.


 **A system of linear equations has**
1. no solution, or
2. exactly one solution, or
3. infinitely many solutions.


 A system of linear equations is said to be **consistent** 
if it has either 
* **one solution** or 
* **infinitely many solutions**.


 A system is **inconsistent** if it has 
* no solution.

## Matrix Notation

 The essential information of a linear system can be 
recorded compactly in a rectangular array called a **matrix**.
Given the system,

$$
\begin{align*}
x_1-2x_2+x_3 &= 0 \\
2x_2-8x_3 &= 8 \\
-4x_1+5x_2+9x_3 &= -9 \\
\end{align*} \tag{3}
$$,

with the coefficients of each variable aligned in columns, 
the matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 \\
0 & 2 & -8 \\
-4 & 5 & 9 
\end{bmatrix} 
$$

is called the **coefficient matrix** (or **matrix of coefficients**) of
the system.


 An **augmented matrix** of a system 
consists of 
the coefficient matrix 
with an added column containing
the constants from the right sides of the equations. 

For the given system of equations,

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 &0\\
0 & 2 & -8 &8\\
-4 & 5 & 9 &-9
\end{bmatrix} \tag{4}
$$

is called the **augmented matrix** of the system.

> * augmented matrix (첨가행렬)

## Matrix Size

 The size of a matrix tells how many rows and
columns it has. If $$m$$ and $$n$$ are positive integers, 
an **$$m \times n$$ matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers 
with $$m$$ rows and $$n$$ columns. 
(The number of rows always comes first.)


## Solving a Linear System

 The basic strategy for solving a linear system is 
*to replace one system with an **equivalent** system 
(i.e., one with the same solution set) 
that is easier to solve.*

## Example 1 

Solve the given system of equations.

$$
\begin{align}
x_1-2x_2+x_3 &= 0 \tag{1}\\
2x_2-8x_3 &= 8 \tag{2}\\
-4x_1+5x_2+9x_3 &= -9 \tag{3}\\
\end{align}
$$,

### Solution of Example 1

 The elimination procedure is shown here 
with and without matrix notation, and 
the results are placed side by side for comparison.

$$
\begin{matrix}
\begin{align*}
x_1-2x_2+x_3 &= 0 \\
2x_2-8x_3 &= 8 \\
-4x_1+5x_2+9x_3 &= -9 
\end{align*}
&
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 &0\\
0 & 2 & -8 &8\\
-4 & 5 & 9 &-9
\end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

Keep $$x_1$$ in the first equation and eliminate it from the other equations. 
To do so, add 4 times equation 1 to equation 3.

$$
\begin{align*}
4x_1-8x_2+4x_3 &= 0 \\
-4x_1+5x_2+9x_3 &= -9 \\
\hline
-3x_2+13x_3 &= -9 
\end{align*}
$$

The result of this calculation is written in place of 
the original third equation:

$$
\begin{matrix}
\begin{align*}
x_1-2x_2+x_3 &= 0 \\
2x_2-8x_3 &= 8 \\
-3x_2+13x_3 &= -9 
\end{align*}
&
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 &0\\
0 & 2 & -8 &8\\
0 & -3 & 13 &-9
\end{bmatrix}
\end{matrix}
$$

Now, multiply equation 2 by $$\frac{1}{2}$$ 
in order to obtain 1 as the coefficient for $$x_2$$


$$
\begin{align}
\begin{matrix}
x_1-2x_2+x_3 &= 0 \\
x_2-4x_3 &= 4 \\
-3x_2+13x_3 &= -9 
\end{matrix}
& &
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 &0\\
0 & 1 & -4 &4\\
0 & -3 & 13 &-9
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

Use the $$x_2$$ in equation 2 
to eliminate the $$-3x_2$$ in equation 3.

$$
\begin{align*}
3x_2-12x_3 &= 12 \\
-3x_2+13x_3 &= -9 \\
\hline
x_3 &= 3 
\end{align*}
$$

The new system has a **triangular** form.

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{matrix}
x_1-2x_2+x_3 &= 0 \\
x_2-4x_3 &= 4 \\
x_3 &= 3 
\end{matrix}
& &
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & -4 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

Eventually, you want to eliminate $$-2x_2$$ the term from equation 1, 
but it is more efficient to use the $$x_3$$ term in equation 3 
first to eliminate 
the $$-4x_3$$ and $$x_3$$ terms in equations 2 and 1.

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{matrix}
&&4x_3 &= 12 \\
&x_2&-4x_3 &= 4 \\
\hline
&x_2& &= 16 
\end{matrix}
& &
\begin{matrix}
&&-x_3 &= -3 \\
x_1&-2x_2&+x_3 &= 0 \\ 
\hline
x_1&-2x_2& &= -3 
\end{matrix}
\end{align}
$$

Now, combine the results of these two operations.

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{matrix}
x_1-2x_2 &= -3 \\
x_2 &= 16 \\
x_3 &= 3 
\end{matrix}
& &
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 & 0 & -3\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 16\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

Move back to the $$x_2$$ in equation 2, 
and use it to eliminate the $$-2x_2$$ above it. 
Because of the previous work with $$x_3$$, 
there is now no arithmetic involving $$x_3$$ terms. 
Add 2 times equation 2 to equation 1 and obtain the system:

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{matrix}
x_1 &= 29 \\
x_2 &= 16 \\
x_3 &= 3 
\end{matrix}
& &
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 29\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 16\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

Thus, the only solution of the original system is
(29,16,3). To verify that (29,16,3) is a solution,
substitute these values into the left side of the
original system, and compute.

$$
\begin{align*}
(29)-2(16)+(3)     &= 29-32+3 &= 0 \\
2(16)-8(3)         &= 32-24   &= 8 \\
-4(29)+5(16)+9(3)  &= -116+80+27 &= -9
\end{align*}
$$

The results agree with the right side(우변) of the original 
system, so (29,16,3) is a solution of the system. $$\blacksquare$$

## Elementary Row Operations

Three basic operations are used to simplify a linear system.

These **Elementary row operations** include the following:

1. (Replacement) Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row.
   = Add to one row a multiple of another row.
2. (Interchange) Interchange two rows.
3. (Scaling) Multiply all entries in a row by a nonzero constant.


 Two matrices are called **row equivalent** if there is 
a sequence of elementary row operations that 
transforms one matrix into the other.

 It is important to note that row operations are **reversible**.

> If the augmented matrices of two linear systems are **row equivalent**, 
> then the two systems have the **same solution set**.


> * elementary row operations (RIS)
> * row equivalent
> * row operations are reversible.


## Existence and Uniqueness of System of Equations

Two fundamental questions about a linear system are as follows:
1. Is the system **consistent**; that is, does at least one solution exist?
2. If a solution exists, is it the only one; that is, is the solution **unique**?


## Example 3: 

Determine if the following system is consistent:

$$
\begin{align}
x_2-4x_3 &= 8 \\
2x_1-3x_2+2x_3 &= 1 \\
5x_1-8x_2+7x_3 &= 1
\end{align} \tag{5}
$$

### Solution: 

* The augmented matrix is

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & -4 & 8 \\
2 & -3 & 2 & 1 \\
5 & -8 & 7 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* To obtain an $$x_1$$ in the first equation, interchange rows 1 and 2:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -3 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -4 & 8 \\
5 & -8 & 7 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* To eliminate the $$5x_1$$ term in the third equation, add $$\frac{-5}{2}$$ times row 1 to row 3.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -3 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -4 & 8 \\
0 & \frac{-1}{2} & 2 & \frac{-3}{2} 
\end{bmatrix} \tag{6}
$$

* Next, use the $$x_2$$ term in the second equation to eliminate the $$-\frac{1}{2}x_2$$ term from the third equaton. Add $$\frac{1}{2}$$ times row 2 to row 3.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -3 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & -4 & 8 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{5}{2} 
\end{bmatrix} \tag{7}
$$

* The augmented matrix is now in triangular form. To interpret it correctly, go back to equation notation.

$$
\begin{align}
2x_1-3x_2+2x_3 &= 1 \\
x_2-4x_3 &= 8 \\
0 &= \frac{5}{2}
\end{align} \tag{8}
$$

* The equation $$0=\frac{5}{2}$$ is a short form of $$0x_1+0x_2+0x_3=\frac{5}{2}$$.
* There are no values of $$x_1,x_2,x_3$$ that satisfy (8) because the equation $$0=\frac{5}{2}$$ is never true.
* Since (8) and (5) have the same solution set, the original system is **inconsistent** (i.e., has no solution).
